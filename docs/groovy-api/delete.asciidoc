[[delete]]
== Delete API

The delete API is very similar to the
{java}/delete.html[Java delete API], here is an
example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
def deleteF = node.client.delete {
    index "test"
    type "type1"
    id "1"
}
--------------------------------------------------
