== Count API

The count API allows one to easily execute a query and get the number of
matches for that query. It can be executed across one or more indices
and across one or more types. The query can be provided using the
{ref}/query-dsl.html[Query DSL].

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
import static org.elasticsearch.index.query.FilterBuilders.*;
import static org.elasticsearch.index.query.QueryBuilders.*;

CountResponse response = client.prepareCount("test")
        .setQuery(termQuery("_type", "type1"))
        .execute()
        .actionGet();

{ref}/search-count.html[count] docs.


=== Operation Threading

The count API allows one to set the threading model the operation will be
performed when the actual execution of the API is performed on the same
node (the API is executed on a shard that is allocated on the same
server).

There are three threading modes.The `NO_THREADS` mode means that the
count operation will be executed on the calling thread. The
`SINGLE_THREAD` mode means that the count operation will be executed on
a single different thread for all local shards. The `THREAD_PER_SHARD`
mode means that the count operation will be executed on a different
thread for each local shard.

The default mode is `SINGLE_THREAD`.
