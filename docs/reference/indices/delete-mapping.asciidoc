== Delete Mapping

Allow to delete a mapping (type) along with its data. The REST endpoints are

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------

[DELETE] /{index}/{type}        
    
[DELETE] /{index}/{type}/_mapping      

[DELETE] /{index}/_mapping/{type}  

--------------------------------------------------

where

[horizontal]

`index`::  `* | _all | glob pattern | name1, name2, …` 
`type`::  `* | _all | glob pattern | name1, name2, …` 

Note, most times, it make more sense to reindex the data into a fresh
index compared to delete large chunks of it.
