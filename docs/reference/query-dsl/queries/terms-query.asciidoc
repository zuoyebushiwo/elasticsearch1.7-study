=== Terms Query

A query that match on any (configurable) of the provided terms. This is
a simpler syntax query for using a `bool` query with several `term`
queries in the `should` clauses. For example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "terms" : {
        "tags" : [ "blue", "pill" ],
        "minimum_should_match" : 1
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The `terms` query is also aliased with `in` as the query name for
simpler usage.
