=== Filter Facets

include::deprecated.asciidoc[]

NOTE: The equivalent aggregation would be the
<<search-aggregations-bucket-filter-aggregation,`filter`>>
aggregation.

A filter facet (not to be confused with a
<<search-facets,facet filter>>) allows you to
return a count of the hits matching the filter. The filter itself can be
expressed using the <<query-dsl,Query DSL>>. For
example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "facets" : {
        "wow_facet" : {
            "filter" : {
                "term" : { "tag" : "wow" }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Note, filter facet filters are faster than query facet when using native
filters (non query wrapper ones).
