== Config Mappings

Creating new mappings can be done using the
<<indices-put-mapping,Put Mapping>>
API. When a document is indexed with no mapping associated with it in
the specific index, the
<<mapping-dynamic-mapping,dynamic / default
mapping>> feature will kick in and automatically create mapping
definition for it.

Mappings can also be provided on the node level, meaning that each index
created will automatically be started with all the mappings defined
within a certain location.

Mappings can be defined within files called `[mapping_name].json` and be
placed either under `config/mappings/_default` location, or under
`config/mappings/[index_name]` (for mappings that should be associated
only with a specific index).
