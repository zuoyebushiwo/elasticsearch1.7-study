Index Modules are modules created per index and control all aspects
related to an index. Since those modules lifecycle are tied to an index,
all the relevant modules settings can be provided when creating an index
(and it is actually the recommended way to configure an index).

== Index Settings

There are specific index level settings that are not associated with any
specific module. These include:

[[index-compound-format]]`index.compound_format`::

        experimental[]
	Should the compound file format be used (boolean or float setting).
	The compound format was created to reduce the number of open
	file handles when using file based storage.  If you set this
        to `false` be sure the OS is also configured to give
	Elasticsearch ``enough'' file handles.
    See <<file-descriptors>>.
+
Alternatively, `compound_format` can be set to a number between `0` and
`1`, where `0` means `false`, `1` means `true` and a number in between
represents a percentage: if the merged segment is less than this
percentage of the total index, then it is written in compound format,
otherwise it is written in non-compound format.
+
Default is 0.1.

[[index-compound-on-flush]]`index.compound_on_flush`::

    experimental[]
    Should a new segment (create by indexing, not by merging) be written
    in compound format or non-compound format? Defaults to `true`.
    This is a dynamic setting.

`index.refresh_interval`::
	A time setting controlling how often the
	refresh operation will be executed. Defaults to `1s`. Can be set to `-1`
	in order to disable it.

`index.shard.check_on_startup`::
        experimental[]
        Should shard consistency be checked upon opening.
        When `true`, the shard will be checked, preventing it from being open in
        case some segments appear to be corrupted.
        When `fix`, the shard will also be checked but segments that were reported
        as corrupted will be automatically removed.
        Default value is `false`, which doesn't check shards.

NOTE: Checking shards may take a lot of time on large indices.

WARNING: Setting `index.shard.check_on_startup` to `fix` may result in data loss,
         use with caution.
