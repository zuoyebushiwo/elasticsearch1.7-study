==== Aggregations

The `date_histogram` aggregation now support a simplified `offset` option that replaces the previous `pre_offset` and
`post_offset` which are deprecated in 1.5. Instead of having to specify two separate offset shifts of the underlying buckets, the `offset` option
moves the bucket boundaries in positive or negative direction depending on its argument.

Also for `date_histogram`, options for `pre_zone` and `post_zone` options and the `pre_zone_adjust_large_interval` parameter
are deprecated in 1.5 and replaced by the already existing `time_zone` option. The behavior of `time_zone` is equivalent to the former
`pre_zone` option.
