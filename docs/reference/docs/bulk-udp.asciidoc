== Bulk UDP API

WARNING: Bulk UDP has been deprecated and will be removed in Elasticsearch 2.0.
You should use <<docs-bulk,the standard bulk API>> instead.

A Bulk UDP service is a service listening over UDP for bulk format
requests. The idea is to provide a low latency UDP service that allows
to easily index data that is not of critical nature.

The Bulk UDP service is disabled by default, but can be enabled by
setting `bulk.udp.enabled` to `true`.

The bulk UDP service performs internal bulk aggregation of the data and
then flushes it based on several parameters: 

`bulk.udp.bulk_actions`:: 
	 The number of actions to flush a bulk after,
	defaults to `1000`. 

`bulk.udp.bulk_size`:: 
	 The size of the current bulk request to flush
	the request once exceeded, defaults to `5mb`. 

`bulk.udp.flush_interval`:: 
	 An interval after which the current
	request is flushed, regardless of the above limits. Defaults to `5s`. 
`bulk.udp.concurrent_requests`:: 
	 The number on max in flight bulk
	requests allowed. Defaults to `4`.

The allowed network settings are:

`bulk.udp.host`:: 
	The host to bind to, defaults to `network.host`
	which defaults to any. 

`bulk.udp.port`:: 
	The port to use, defaults to `9700-9800`. 

`bulk.udp.receive_buffer_size`:: 
	The receive buffer size, defaults to `10mb`.

Here is an example of how it can be used:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
> cat bulk.txt
{ "index" : { "_index" : "test", "_type" : "type1" } }
{ "field1" : "value1" }
{ "index" : { "_index" : "test", "_type" : "type1" } }
{ "field1" : "value1" }
--------------------------------------------------

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
> cat bulk.txt | nc -w 0 -u localhost 9700
--------------------------------------------------
