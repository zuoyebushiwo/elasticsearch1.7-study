== Analysis

The index analysis module acts as a configurable registry of Analyzers
that can be used in order to break down indexed (analyzed) fields when a
document is indexed as well as to process query strings. It maps to the Lucene
`Analyzer`.

Analyzers are (generally) composed of a single `Tokenizer` and zero or
more `TokenFilters`. A set of `CharFilters` can be associated with an
analyzer to process the characters prior to other analysis steps. The
analysis module allows one to register `TokenFilters`, `Tokenizers` and
`Analyzers` under logical names that can then be referenced either in
mapping definitions or in certain APIs. The Analysis module
automatically registers (*if not explicitly defined*) built in
analyzers, token filters, and tokenizers.

See <<analysis>> for configuration details.
